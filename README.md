Ninja Gaiden Sigam 2 TMC Blender Extension
==========================================

Author: Nozomi Miyamori

A blender extension to import Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 TMC into
your blender project.

Requirements
------------

* Blender 4.2 or above

Installation
------------

1. Download `ninja_gaiden_tmc-{version}.zip` from the releases page
1. Open Blender's Preferences panel
1. Go to "Get Extensions"
1. Select "Install from the Disk" from the pull down menu

Caveats
-------

* It does not import material parameters (e.g. color, metalness, roughness) yet
* It does not support exporting a blender project to an TMC file
* It may not import some TMC models (I tested the extension only with some human models)
